# Medical-Drug-Prediction
A Machine Learning model is trained to predict the medical drug which is correctly responsive for the patients who are suffering from same illness.

### About Dataset
It is a Kaggle Dataset which contains the Data about 3000 patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y.
The feature sets of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol, Na_to_K level of patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.

### Abou Project
In this project, the dataset is analysed and trained with three different classification algorithms. They are:
* KNN
* Decision Tree
* Logistic Regression

In Evaluation, three scores (Jaccard similarity score, f1 score, and accuracy score) are calculated for each algorithm and chosen the best one.
